  <p>In this example of <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom">d3-zoom</a> , the <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/README.md#zoom-transforms">transform</a>'s translate x and y are ignored; only the scale k is observed, allowing zooming around a fixed focal point. The focal point in world coordinates is represented by the variables fx and fy. The view is translated such that this point appears at the middle of the display.</p>
